# JavaScript-The-Quiz
A timed quiz on the subject of JavaScript

## HTML
* This project has a basic HTML structure
* There are two separate HTML pages; One is the main quiz, the other, a highscore page.
* Most of the HTML is being generated in JavaScript.

## CSS
* There is a good amount of CSS in this project.
* There are also two CSS pages; One for the main quiz, and the other for the highscore page.
* I created a basic centered design with purple and green.
* I used flexbox for most of the layout.

## JavaScript
* This project is mainly JavaScript.
* There is still a lot of work to do here.
* The quiz isn't fully functional but there are a few working things.
* I have been stumped.
